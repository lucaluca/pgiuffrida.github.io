Plenario makes it possible to rethink the way we use open data. Instead of being constrained by the data that is accessible and usable, let’s start by formulating our questions and then find the data to answer them. Plenario makes this easy by tying together all datasets on one map and one timeline—because in the real world, everything affects everything else.

In my work for Brett Goldstein at the University of Chicago, I served as the product manager for the Plenario project. I helped design and coordinate its construction, communicating the vision for the project to internal developers and external stakeholders. I conducted user testing, and then developed the message, branding, and presentation for the platform's highly successful September 2014 public launch, and served as main press contact after launch.
