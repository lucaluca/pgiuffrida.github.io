As someone with experience studying and working in the humanities, I know that quotes, or small pieces of text such as poems and song lyrics, are essential to self-expression for a very large number of people. Yet it seems that the Internet lacks a good place for people to collect and analyze small pieces of text and study how they interconnect. [Pindar](https://pindar.pythonanywhere.com), named for one of the first Greek lyric poets, is an attempt to create that place.

<div class="caption">Intelligent, user-powered site for quote collection and analysis.</div>

###Project scope
Pindar differs from other quote sites in a number of important ways:

* It is 100% user-powered, meaning that actual people submit and vouch for every quote
* It is open source under the MIT license, making it free to use, copy, and contribute to the code base
* It makes all data available via intelligent searching and an API for use in other applications
* It is built from the ground up to be *smarter*: quotes can be linked to each other on the basis of allusion, influence, and similar topics, and selected into user-created anthologies

Pindar also includes functionality you would expect, such as the ability to rate and comment on quotes, and edit all information submitted by other users for accuracy. 

###The solution
Pindar is built using the Python framework web2py, which helps quickly create complex sites, and hosted by PythonAnywhere. The concept and initial code was a collaboration between me and [mrbeskin](https://github.com/mrbeskin), and the current version is by me. 

All the quotes on this site link to their pages on Pindar.

###Impact
Pindar is built to scale, and there are many more features under development.
