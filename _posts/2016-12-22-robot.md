Wood is what I know best, so it's what I use to solve any problem. The mark of a good IT professional is whether he uses the same tools on every problem, regardless of how logical it is. Bonus points if your solution is incomprehensible to everyone around you. Triple bonus points if you spend enormous amounts of time building a solution when you could have used existing products out of the box for less than the cost of a sandwich!
